# Titanic_Survival
This tutorial aims to give an accessible introduction to how to use machine learning techniques for beginners.
The objective is to predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics! Therefore, I am going to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Problem definition
Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, the scope of our model will be to determine (based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information) if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.
